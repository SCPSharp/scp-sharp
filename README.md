## Compatibility

#### [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu)

All things well but there is no configuration screen because no configuration file is in need.

#### [REI](https://github.com/shedaniel/RoughlyEnoughItems)

Recipes for SCP-914 are able to display in REI.

#### [Minecraft Meme Resource Pack](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/mcwzh-meme-resourcepack)

We have an official translation support for `zh_meme`. This language only shows when the `mcwzh-meme-resourcepack` is installed.

## FAQ

#### Why is the model of SCP-173 not good-looking?

I wanna, but I could not make it better. We tried our best.

If you can make a better model, thanks, really!

#### Blink effect for SCP-173 does not render on client side?

Yeah, it is kind of difficult to get the tick timer on the client and the tick reference should never be synchronized to the client. There will be some delay if the time of the computer is used.

#### CurseForge?

No, unless they support syncing README to project description via Gradle

## Contributing
