## Compatibility

#### Mod Menu

All things well but there is no configuration screen because no configuration file is in need.

#### REI

Recipes for SCP-914 are able to display in REI.

## FAQ

#### Why is the model of SCP-173 not good-looking?

It is the best for me. I could not make it better. I tried to ask for help, but we tried our best.

If you can make a better model, thanks, really!

#### Blink effect for SCP-173 does not render on client side?

Yeah, it is kind of difficult to get the tick timer on the client and the tick reference should never be synchronized to the client, so I could not know "Is time for wink?" on the client. There will be some delay if the time of the computer is used.
