> SCP: Sharp is a mod for Minecraft about SCP Foundation

## SCP Subjects

- SCP-173
- SCP-500
- SCP-914

## Compatibility

#### Mod Menu

All things well but there is no configuration screen because no configuration file is in need.

#### REI

Recipes for SCP-914 are able to display in REI.

## FAQ

#### Why is the model of SCP-173 not good-looking?

I wanna, but I could not make it better. We tried our best.

If you can make a better model, thanks, really!

#### Blink effect for SCP-173 does not render on client side?

Yeah, it is kind of difficult to get the tick timer on the client and the tick reference should never be synchronized to the client, so I could not know "Is time for wink?" on the client. There will be some delay if the time of the computer is used.
